# VB.NET-PiFmRds
Using PiFmRds by Christophe Jacquet(https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds), this application acts as an "SSH control panel" for your Raspberry Pi.
It allows you to change the frequency, program service (PS), and radio text (RT) settings. You can also ping your Raspberry Pi, connect to it, and start or stop PiFmRds.
Additionally, I have implemented a live temperature meter that can be started or stopped. The application also provides options to reboot or shut down your Raspberry Pi.

Features:

Change frequency, PS (8-character name), and RT settings
Ping your Raspberry Pi
Connect to the Raspberry Pi
Start/stop PiFmRds
Live temperature meter (start/stop)
Reboot or shut down the Raspberry Pi
